In the above projectI had implemented a shopping cart system with user authorisation.
For front-end I  used React and Tailwind Css
For state management used Radux.js
And for authentication and items I used dummyjson.com
Here are the features what I implemented:-
1.After succesfull login the authenticated user is redirected to home page and the user token is stored as a state in the redux store for future validation
2.In the home there are three sections 
 i.   Searching and sorting:- From this tab user can search for specific product and filter the products on the basis of their price
 ii.  Product display:- In this tab the list of products are shown from where user can see the details of the product and add the item to the cart
 iii. Cart:- In this section user can see their cart items and they can also increment and decrement the quantity of the products and also can remove the item from the cart on a button click and the total price     
             will change dynamically with the change of the quantity and product.
Here is the deployed link of the app:-https://timely-tartufo-04ab54.netlify.app/
